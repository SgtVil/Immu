\title{Plot the variance for two factors.}
\usage{
plot_xy_variance(
  variance,
  x,
  y,
  corrected = F,
  col_vector = c("purple", "orange", "brown", "grey"),
  max.overlap = 20,
  size = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variance}{An object returned by \link{calculate_variance}.}

\item{x}{Factor to be plotted as x.}

\item{y}{Factor to be plotted as y.}

\item{corrected}{Use p value adjusted by FDR or not for the text only. Default=F. IMPORTANT, by default the corrected value is settled as FALSE, this mean
it will print the labels for the features significant before correction.}

\item{col_vector}{A color vector for the plotting.}

\item{max.overlap}{The text repelling overlap}

\item{size}{Size of the dots.}
}
\value{
A ggplot.
